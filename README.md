# fwutils
binutils.py solves the following task:
1. There are 2 binary files with the same size: bin1 and bin2 (in the same directory with script).
2. We believe they each have the same chunk of unknown size (i.e., more than 20 KB and less than 32 KB). 
3. We want to find this chunk in each file and do it as quickly as possible.
This is my solution, it's pretty time consuming. 
I'm not sure if it's the quickest way. Any suugestions?
